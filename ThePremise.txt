Submaria - Exploration Adventure Game
In Submaria, The world is solely made up of planet sized Aquariums, the only land being the borders between each Aquarium. You are a lone person piloting a submarine where it's only you and the sea creatures. There are no other people, only remnants of civilization underwater. The story begins as soon as you start the game and enter the world, where every bit and piece of it is scattered. Your goal is not known at first, but you will find clues scattered around the world that will piece together a place to escape the harsh realities of ocean life. Players will wake up and be greeted by a basic Text-Adventure introduction sequence that segments or transitions into a maze-like game which also transitions back into something more Text-Based again to find clues and notes that include more background into the story and also hints at where to go. The player will fully realize their goal and be able to access a hidden area that will be the end game.
