In Submaria, The world is solely made up of planet sized Aquariums, the only land being the borders between each Aquarium. You are a lone person piloting a submarine where it's only you and the sea creatures. There are no other people, only remnants of civilization underwater. The story begins as soon as you start the game and enter the world, where every bit and piece of it is scattered. Your goal is not known at first, but you will find clues scattered around the world that will piece together a place to escape the harsh realities of ocean life.
