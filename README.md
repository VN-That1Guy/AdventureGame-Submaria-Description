# :ocean: Submarina: An Underwater Exploration Adventure Game! :ocean: 
A description repo about my personal Adventure Game Project for Introduction to Programming!

## Game Overview
When you finally wake up and head out in to the open in your submarine, you will find out that there is no one around. It is only up to you to find out what happeend to every one and to find a way out as finding out what as happened to them will happen to you will be your end.

### World
The player will be exploring in what is basically an Aquarium where they will traverse through decorations that are normally found in many big aquariums but are actually served as structures that people live in. Players will mainly be searching for notes and clues through out the game. There are also side notes and items that the player can randomly find as they move around. The player can check their inventory and select a item to read what's on it.

### Characters
There are no physically present characters that the player will meet and be able to talk to but they will find notes left by survivors that will hint at the player their goal when the player reads it. 

### Player Goals
As the player progresses, they will come to a conclusion to what has happened to every one and will realize their ultimate goal, escaping the aquarium. The game requires that the player needs to find three key notes, each in one designated area that is marked on the map that the player will view commonly. The game will let them know if they already found the note in the place they are in. Another factor would be another item that players may or may not come across before they reach the final area that is hidden and inaccessible on the map. As the game ends, it tracks and displays the status of the players inventory, how much they moved, how much they have searched in all areas, and display if they have triggered something fun in the intro. The last part doesn't matter but it is nice to let the players know that there is a little something extra that they might like to see.
